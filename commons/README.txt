This directory contains the list of JPG, PNG and GIF files found on Wikimedia Commons.
Originally requested by Jeroen van den Bos for his joint research with Tijs van der Storm on parsing formatted binary data, it is free (CC-BY-SA) for anyone else to use as well.

The list is derived by a simple Python script from the data dump available from Wikimedia:
	http://dumps.wikimedia.org/commonswiki/20121118/
(If you want a newer one, change TIMESTAMP in the Makefile and run 'make get' and then 'make extract')
The script is so trivial that it is very unlikely for something to break.

The data itself is distributed under open licenses GNU FDL and CC-BY-SA:
